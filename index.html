          <p>Hi there! I'm Fabio.</p>

          <p>I'm a Software Engineer based in Stockholm. I'm head of engineering at <a href="https://hopsworks.ai">Hopsworks AB</a> the company developing the <a href="http://hopsworks.ai">Hopsworks</a> feature store.</p>

          <p>Hopsworks is a Feature Store providing data scientists with a unique platform to govern, share and make features available for training models, batch scoring and building real time prediction services.
            Hopsworks sits in between the modern data stack (e.g. Snowflake, Data Lakes, Streams) and the data scientists. It provides them with clear and python centric APIs to tap into the vast amount of existing enterprise data and allows them to build and productionize models with the tools they are most familiar with (e.g. Python, Pandas, PyTorch). If you are curious, you can start building on Hopsworks today at <a href="http://app.hopsworks.ai">https://app.hopsworks.ai</a>
          </p>

          <p>In my current role I'm responsible for the design and implementation of the feature store component. I spend a significant amount of my time interacting with customers and users to understand their needs and requirements, and then coordinate the implementation. Since February 2022 I also sit on the board of the company</p>

          <p>
            Sometimes I travel the world to talk about Hopsworks. Here's some of the most recent talks I gave:
            <ul>

            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>I graduated from the <a href="https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/programmes/ccs/">EIT Digital Master School</a> with a major in Cloud Computing and Services with a minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. I spent my first year at TU Berlin and the second one at KTH Stockholm.
          During my master thesis I worked on extending the Apache Hive metastore to achieve strong consistency between the metadata on the database and the files on HopsFS. You can read my <a href="http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1149002&dswid=-3913">Master Thesis</a> for more details.
          </p>

          <p>I'm passionate about technology and I love to get my hands dirty, you can take a look at some of my side projects on my <a href="https://github.com/siroibaf">Github</a> profile. </p>
