          <p>Hi there! I'm Fabio.</p>

          <p>I'm an Italian Software Engineer based in Stockholm. I'm head of engineering at <a href="https://logicalclocks.com">Logical Clocks AB</a> the company leading the development efforts of the <a href="http://hops.io">HopsHadoop</a> platform.</p>

          <p>Hops is a big data platform with a focus on Deep Learning. The platform makes it easy for Data Scientists to achieve hyperscale training for their DL models with tools such as TensorFlowOnSpark and Horovod.
           It provides GPUs-as-a-resource, Jupyter and PySpark, management of Conda environments and a lot of other goodies.
          It is based on HopsFS, the world's most scalable file system. A fork of Apache HDFS, which stores files' and directories' metadata on a distributed, new sql database. We wrote a bunch of peer reviewed papers on the platform, <a href="http://www.hops.io/publications/">have a look!</a>

          <p>Currently, I'm focusing my efforts on building a scalable model serving infrastructure, based on Kubernetes and integrated with the Hops platform and its security model based on X.509 certificates.
          I'm also involved in the design and development of a Feature Store for Hops and integrated with TensorFlow.
          Previously I modified the Apache Hive metastore to achieve strong consistency between the metadata on the database and the files on HopsFS. You can read my <a href="http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1149002&dswid=-3913">Master Thesis</a> for more details.
          </p>

          <p>Sometimes I travel the world to talk about Hops. Here's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-tn9jFy3yM">link</a> to the talk I gave at FOSDEM 2018. I also presented at <a href="https://www.re-work.co/events/deep-learning-summit-boston-2018/schedule">ReWork Deep Learning Summit</a> and <a href="https://odsc.com/training/portfolio/distributed-deep-learning-hops-2">ODSC</a>. Sadly no videos are publicly available for these last two.

          <p>I graduated from the <a href="https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/programmes/ccs/">EIT Digital Master School</a> with a major in Cloud Computing and Services with a minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. I spent my first year at TU Berlin and the second one at KTH Stockholm.</p>

          <p>I'm passionate about technology and I love to get my hands dirty, you can take a look at some of my side projects on my <a href="https://github.com/siroibaf">Github</a> profile. </p>

          <p>You can get in touch with me by dropping a line at {surname.name [at] gmail.com} or using <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/fabiobuso">Linkedin</a>.</p>
